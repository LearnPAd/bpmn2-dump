# Introduction

This project builds an application that reads a BPMN2 file which uses the `http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL` namespace and dumps some information about it, namely the resources and the processes contained in it.

This application is meant to be used as a template for building more complex tools and components in the Learn PAd project.
